# hotel_booking_prediction
To predict whether a customer will book a hotel or not, a model needs
to be constructed in hotel booking prediction. This model must be
capable of accurate predictions.The goal is to produce a probability
score that can be used by hotels to optimize their pricing, marketing,
and room availability strategies. To achieve this, we begin with data
pre processing, which includes cleaning and analyzing data with both
quantitative and qualitative variables. Continuous variables are scaled,
while discrete variables undergo label encoding. The next step is to train
various deep learning algorithms to predict hotel bookings and assess their
performance. Through this process, we found that LSTM outperformed
with an accuracy rate of 82 %.
